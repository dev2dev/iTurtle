When my 8 year old mentioned he wanted to learn to program I thought about the best way to introduce it to him.  
One of my ideas was to start with Logo (or Turtle Graphics as it's also known).

After a bit of searching I found xlogo by Jens Bauer.  It's a small objective-c implementation of Logo with a very 
clean implementation.  After looking at it I thought "Hey, I could make a iPad app" and hence was born iTurtle.

Sadly, Apple does not allow 'interpreters' on the app store so this is only available if you have a dev license and 
care to compile and install it on your iPad.

Enjoy
