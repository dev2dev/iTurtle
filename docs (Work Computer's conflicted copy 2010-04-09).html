Welcome to iTurtle -- iTurtle is a fun iPad app that helps teach the basics of computer programming.  

iTurtle can also create fairly complex graphics with very simple commands.  It's a great way to explore
your createive side.  let's start with a simple example.  Use the 'copy and paste' feature to grab the code below and paste
it into the command window of iTurtle then hit 'go' to see wha happens.  Once you've done that 
come back here.


<hr />
<pre>
		forward 100
		right 90
		forward 100
		right 90
		forward 100
		right 90
		forward 100
</pre>
<hr />

Pretty neat huh? Try changing some of the values to see how it effects it.  <br />

iTurtle uses Logo as it's command language -- there are a number of commands that it understandss. 




		<ul>
			<li>FORWARD x</li>
			<li>BACKWARD x</li>
			<li>RIGHT x</li>
			<li>LEFT x</li>
			<li>PENUP</li>
			<li>PENDOWN</li>
			<li>HOME - go back to (0,0)</li>
			<li>CLEAR - clear the screen</li>
			<li>REPEAT x [command]</li>
		</ul>	
		<i>The letter "x" above should be replaced by a number representing the number of
		spaces to move (in the case of FORWARD and BACKWARD commands), the number
		of degress to turn (in the case of RIGHT and LEFT), or the number of repetitions (REPEAT command).  You can also use 'Random' to place it a random number</i>
		
		
		&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Advanced commands:</u>
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li>NEWTURTLE "name - create a new turtle, with a name</li>
			<li>TALKTO "name - send commands to a specific turtle</li>
			<li>MAKE "name [value] - create a variable with a value</li>
			<li>SETCOLOR :[color|variable] - set the drawing color</li>
			<li>SETBG :[color|variable] - set the background color</li>
		</ul>	
		
		
		Here is a another example using some of the advanced commands.
